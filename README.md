# Galactic-Gold-Rush
This is an original, turn-based board game where two players compete to explore space and mine asteroids for riches. First one to collect 15 gold wins. The game is currently playable in the Unity editor, but it is a work-in-progress with several new additions on the way. The goal is to publish the game to a website once more work has been completed.

Game overview:

Both players control 3 ships with which they explore their surroundings in the outer reaches of space. All ships begin in the middle of the hexagonal map, occupying the 6 central spaces that make up the home base. 12 randomly placed asteroids are scattered among the 90 other board spaces, but none of the asteroids are visible at the start of the game.

During a turn, players move each ship they control to one of the three board spaces adjacent to the ship’s current location. If the newly occupied space contains an asteroid, that asteroid now becomes visible and that player takes ownership of their new discovery. When a player takes ownership of an asteroid, they begin mining the asteroid of its gold content. Each subsequent turn that an asteroid is controlled by a player, 1 gold is mined and added to a stockpile which accumulates on that asteroid. To collect that gold and count it towards a player’s overall score, a ship must return to the claimed asteroid to pick up the stockpile. That ship must then return to the central home base to deposit all the gold it is carrying. Once a player has repeated these steps enough to deposit a total of 15 or more gold, the game is over, and that player wins.

Game engine built with Unity, graphics designed in Blender. All aspects of the game have been created by Jeffrey Gasvoda.
